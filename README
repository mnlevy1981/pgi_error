The way we use associate calls is understand by most of our supported compilers
(intel, gnu, nag, and cray) but causes errors when built with PGI. This simple
program highlights the issue for us... typical output is:

Building with ifort...
intel.out

Building with gfortran...
gnu.out
intel.out

Building with pgf90...
PGF90-S-0075-Subscript, substring, or argument illegal in this context for second (pgi_err.F90: 42)
PGF90-S-0153-Array objects are not conformable  (pgi_err.F90: 42)
PGF90-S-0455-A derived type array section cannot appear with a member array section - matrix (pgi_err.F90: 42)
  0 inform,   0 warnings,   3 severes, 0 fatal for pgi_err
gnu.out
intel.out
